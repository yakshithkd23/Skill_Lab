To use onlinegdb debugger:
1. "Debug" command will run the debugger  
    We will have debugger console 
    and debugger right side panel
2. debugger console will have further commands 
    like 
    Start Continue StepInto StepOver StepOut 
3. To set the breakpoint inside for loop 
    click before the linenumber inside the for loop 
   i. Click "Start" command to run the debugger 
   ii. The execution will come inside the for loop\
    and stops at break point 
   iii. set the variables in "Display Expressions" section 
    like 
        I 
        salaries[I]
        searchSalary
        salaries[I] == searchSalary
    continue again and again we will 
    trace the display variables to learn the code 
    or logic 
To use gdb:
    gcc -g main.c
    gdb commands 
        run "to start the debuggig" 
        continue "to continue from breakpoint 
                  to next breakpoint" 
        b 13        "set the breakpoint at line# 13"
        info breakpoints 
        d 1        "deletes the breakpoint based on 
                    breakpoint number"
        display I 
        display salaries[I]
        display searchSalary
        display salaries[I] == searchSalary
